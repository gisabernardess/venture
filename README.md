## üí¨ Project

Final project of the Graduate Course in Full Stack Web Development at the Pontifical Catholic University of Minas Gerais as a requirement for obtaining the graduate degree.

The search for innovation is a permanent challenge for companies that want to gain a good place in the market. In this sense, finding ways to promote discussion and the development of innovative solutions is one of the main activities that contribute to this objective. This is where Hackathons events comes in.

Hackathons events are successful in companies from different sectors, including in the current company I am part of, with the aim of exercising creativity, stimulating brainstorming, creating new projects and training employees. In one of these events, an online tabletop RPG game was developed, however it was not completely finished, lacking to create the web interface for the management of players.

Finally, the proposal for this project is the development of the web application with player management, completing the online tabletop RPG game project developed previously.
